Algorithms incorporated calculate shading generated by the walls of experimental raceways that were used to grow algae in Tucson, Arizona, by the Regional Algal Feedstock Testbeds (RAFT) project.
The algorithm first creates a two dimensional mesh for the top plane of the geometry, then calculates the shade for each point in that mesh on the water surface plane based on the solar position at a given time step. The shade is given out graphically and calculated numerically. 
The model crashes in early morning and late afternoon.
A seperate program runs the shading algorithm over the year in a given location then compile a set of data and create a surface regression equation that calulates shading in the experimental raceways as a function of time.  
The same approach can be used to calculate shaded area in different geometries and for different systems.
further information and references on this topic can be found in my dissertation: TEMPERATURE, EVAPORATION, AND SHADING EFFECTS ON ALGAE IN EXPERIMENTAL PADDLEWHEEL RACEWAYS.
